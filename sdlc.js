// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

/*  1. Planning
    2. Analysis of Requirements
    3. Design
    4. Implementation
    5. Testing & Integration
    6. Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
let planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
let analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step in which the contents such as text will be assessed.  The language(s) will also be chosen for the development as well as resources such as developers."
let design = "This is the third step in which we see how the website will look like, how the database will be set up.  It will also answer questions such as how the general structure will look.  Something that helps is the visual representation therefore it is helpful to have drawings depicting the design."
let implementation = " This is the fourth step in which we start coding and implement out design into action.  For example, laying out the code for the design in html or css.  We also build the algorithims and write functions."
let testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step in which we test functionality to see if our implementation works.  This is also where we log all information and ensure we have proper values."
let maintain = "This is the final step in which we make sure all bugs are resolved and our software is able to scale properly.  This is also where we implement adding new features."
